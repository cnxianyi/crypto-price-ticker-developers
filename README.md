## Supported Crypto Data Provider

- **Binance USD-M Futures** - [binance.com](https://binance.com)

## API Rate Limits

> **Important:** Binance Futures enforces API rate limits. Setting a very low refresh interval or tracking too many tickers may result in temporary bans or incomplete data.
>
> - **Binance Futures**: [API rate limits](https://developers.binance.com/docs/derivatives/usds-margined-futures/market-data/rest-api/24hr-Ticker-Price-Change-Statistics) apply per IP and endpoint.
>
> **Recommendation:** Use a refresh interval of 60 seconds or higher and limit the number of tracked tickers for best results. Providing API keys (optional) can help increase your rate limits and access more data.
